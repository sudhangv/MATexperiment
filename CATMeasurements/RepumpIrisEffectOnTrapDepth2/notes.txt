1-12: decreasing repump beam size in sets of 4(so three sets in total)

13-14: same repump size as 8-12, but with repump reference = 2.0

15-16: same repump size as 8-12, but with repump reference = 0.5 

17-19: smaller repump size,  with repump reference = 0.5 

20-21: smallest repump size,  with repump reference = 0.5 

22-23: smallest repump size,  with repump reference = 2.0
